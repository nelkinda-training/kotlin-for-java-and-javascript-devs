Keywords:
  - `fun` declares a function
  - `class` declares a class
  - `val` declares an immutable value
  - `data` modifies a class to be a data class
  - `open` modifies a class to be extensible (by default, Kotlin classes are _not_, as if they were `final` in Java)

Operators:
  - `==` equality (calls .equals() or Objects.equal())
  - `===` identity (like Java `==`)
